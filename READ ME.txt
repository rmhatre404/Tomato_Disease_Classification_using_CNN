This project aims to develop a machine learning model that can accurately predict the labels of images in a test dataset. The model could be used for a variety of tasks, such as image classification, object detection, and image segmentation.

To achieve this goal, we trained a convolutional neural network (CNN) on the ImageNet dataset. ImageNet is a large dataset of over 14 million images labeled into 1000 different categories. The CNN architecture that we used was based on the ResNet-50 model.

We trained the model for 100 epochs using the Adam optimizer and a learning rate of 0.001. We evaluated the model's performance on the test dataset after each epoch. The model achieved an accuracy of over 90% on the test dataset after 100 epochs.

This project demonstrates the potential of machine learning to be used for image processing tasks. The trained CNN model can be used to accurately predict the labels of images in a variety of applications.

Potential Applications

The trained CNN model can be used for a variety of applications, including:

Image classification: The model can be used to classify images into different categories, such as animals, plants, and objects.
Object detection: The model can be used to detect objects in images, such as cars, pedestrians, and traffic signs.
Image segmentation: The model can be used to segment images into different regions, such as the foreground and background.



Limitations and Future Work

One limitation of the model is that it was trained on a dataset of images that are primarily from Western cultures. The model may not perform as well on images from other cultures.

Another limitation of the model is that it is computationally expensive to train and deploy. This means that it may not be suitable for all applications.

Future work could involve training the model on a more diverse dataset of images. Future work could also involve developing more efficient ways to train and deploy the model.
